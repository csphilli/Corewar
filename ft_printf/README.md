# ft_printf
## About

ft_printf is our own version of the standard library's printf. We must replicate the outcome to mirror printf. Some of the new challenges we face when writing this code are the following:
* Becoming familiar with and using variadic functions.
* Implementing various parsing functions that will parse the input string and obtain the different format specifiers and respective modifiers for those values.
* Becoming even more organized with our code. Since we are limited to 25 lines per function, and no more than 5 functions per file, it becomes very important to remain organized so that we do not confuse ourselves about our own program.
* With the various tests available online for this program, we are becoming more cognizant about our code's speed.
