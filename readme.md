Building - Nothing to see here.

## TODO:
- [ ] Check for newline at the end of .s
- [x] Shouldn't accept .s with no instructions (minimum of 1) 
- [ ] Should maybe check that the input file is a .s file (original asm doesn't check, but subject says "It will read the assemblyâ€™s code processed from the file .s given as argument")
